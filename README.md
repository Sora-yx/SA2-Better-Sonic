# Welcome to Sonic: New Tricks v2.0!

This is a mod for the PC version of Sonic Adventure 2. Similar to Better Miles, this mod changes Sonic gameplay in different way, allow him to beat more stage than in the vanilla game and even allow you to remap most of his actions. Interested? Let’s take a look below.

Each feature can be disabled in the mod settings, if you are only interested with the control remapping, you could always disable everything but the controls.

## The Spin Dash has been improved to make it more like SA1

Not only it is faster, there is also no delay so you can spam it as you pleasure.
There is also an option to restore the SA1 Sound if you feel nostalgic a bit.

**Note : The previous version of the mod used to have the spin dash able to pass somersault obstacle, this feature is now optional and off by default since it creates a small issue with slope physics.**

## The Ball Form from SA1 has been restored. 

In SA1, when you jump and Homing Attack, Sonic uses a ball form, this was removed in SA2, but you can now use it if you want.

I personally never really liked how only the somersault was able to destroy the boxes. Therefore, I made it so many different attacks can now break the boxes, including the Spin Dash.

The bounce is now faster and also allow you to go higher. Yeah, that's it, what did you expect? :p

## The bounce for Shadow has been added.

"But Sora, there is already a code in the mod manager for that"
- I'm aware of that, but this feature in the mod has two advantages over the code:
	- the upgrade won't be displayed on him, so it won't look weird.
	- The code originally makes the game crashes when using Metal Sonic's Black Shield, this is not the case here. 

## More levels beatable

Just like Better Miles, this mod will allow Sonic (or any speed character) to beat more stage than what they originally can, most of the Tails and Eggman stages should now be beatable.


## Disable Homing Attack grunt sound.

Self-explanatory, there is option for each speed character to disable the grunt homing attack. This feature is done in code without editing the sound file, so this should be (in theory) fully compatible with mod that edit characters sound effects.

I know you’ve been waiting for this. You always hated that sonic actions share the same button right? Well, you will be happy to know that this mod allows you to remap these actions and let you choice between B, X, and Y. 
**By default, Light Dash is on Y, Bounce is on X, Somersault is on B and Spin Dash is on X. Yeap, here it is!**
 
# Mod compatibility

Unlike Better Miles, this mod should in theory work fine with Character Select Plus, but make sure to load this mod after Character Select. In fact, you should put this mod at the bottom of your mod list.

"Can you add the ball form for Shadow and Amy?"
- I tried, but sadly this creates many issue with Character Select Mod, if you play Sonic then quit and select Shadow or Amy, the game will crash and I have no clue why. I believe this is because Character Select Mod touch the animations, but I'm not entierly sure why this is happening. 

"Can you make a similar mod for the hunters?"
